'''An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world has recruited you. You have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and are tasked with creating an automated script that can extract the list of all countries in order of their GDPs in billion USDs (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since IMF releases this evaluation twice a year, this code will be used by the organization to extract the information as it is updated.

The required data seems to be available on the URL mentioned below:

URL:
'https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185326/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29'
Copied!
The required information needs to be made accessible as a CSV file Countries_by_GDP.csv as well as a table Countries_by_GDP in a database file World_Economies.db with attributes Country and GDP_USD_billion.

Your boss wants you to demonstrate the success of this code by running a query on the database table to display only the entries with more than a 100 billion USD economy. Also, you should log in a file with the entire process of execution named etl_project_log.txt.

You must create a Python code 'etl_project_gdp.py' that performs all the required tasks.'''
